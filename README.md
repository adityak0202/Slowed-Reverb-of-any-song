​The Slowed+Reverb Converter is an audio processing tool that alters music tracks by slowing them down and adding a reverb effect. Implemented using libraries such as Python’s pydub or librosa, the project uses digital signal processing techniques to manipulate audio properties. The slowdown is achieved by stretching the audio waveform, while reverb is applied by simulating sound reflections, resulting in an atmospheric, slowed-down audio experience.
